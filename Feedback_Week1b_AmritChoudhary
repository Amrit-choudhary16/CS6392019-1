I am Amrit Choudhary and I tested the app of Robert Consigliere.
The Min and Target versions of the SDKs are 15 and 28.
I Tested the app on an emulator with OS Pie x86 and on an android device(OnePlus 6) running on PIE.
The app does not crash.
The app does display:
Hello Robert Consigliere
And
Welcome in CS 639 Summer 2019
The name of the student is displayed.
No comment on what should be improved in the app.
